      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Get Me a Chai</strong> is a platform that helps creators receive small tokens of appreciation from their supporters. Whether you're a developer, writer, artist, or educator, this space lets you connect with your audience and receive support in a simple, meaningful way — one chai at a time.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        We believe that every creator deserves encouragement. By offering a casual and friendly environment, supporters can express their appreciation without the friction of complex platforms or large commitments.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        Our goal is to empower independent creators to keep doing what they love — while giving fans and followers a quick way to say "thank you" with a virtual chai ☕.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg">
        Simple. Friendly. Creator-first. That&apos;s what we&apos;re about.
